This project was assigned in the Computer Science II course at Rochester Institute of Technology. We developed a game involving problem-solving, using Java. The game includes player interactions, graphics (GFX), and collaboration with a partner.

My assignment was to work on the Hoppers project, while my partner worked on the Astros project.

For the Hoppers project, the game is based on a board where frogs hop over each other. The goal is to remove all the red frogs from the board. Together, my partner and I developed a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for both Astros and Hoppers to find the shortest path to the goal and win the game.

After implementing the BFS algorithm, we tested it using PTUI, a text-based visualization tool. Then, we focused on our individual games by adding specific rules and functions. Finally, we created a colorful, interactive visualization for the game using JavaGFX.
