# Hoppers and Astros Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains two puzzle-solving games—**Hoppers** and **Astros**—developed in Java as part of a Computer Science II course at Rochester Institute of Technology. The project emphasizes algorithm development, graphical user interface design, and collaborative problem-solving.

### Hoppers

- Board-based puzzle game where frogs hop over each other.
- Objective: Remove all the red frogs from the board.
- Features a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest solution path.
- Includes both text-based (PTUI) and graphical (JavaGFX) visualization tools.

### Astros

- Puzzle game with explorers and astronauts navigating a grid.
- Objective: Bring the astronaut home by moving explorers strategically.
- Implements similar BFS solving logic for shortest pathfinding.
- Interactive board manipulation (move, select, reset) supported in both PTUI and GUI.

Both games share common solver logic and configuration management but differ in their rules and board setups.

## How This Relates to the Software Engineering Intern Role

This project directly reflects the skills and responsibilities described in the Defense and Intelligence Solutions software engineering intern job posting:

### Software Development & Algorithms

- **Languages:** Code is written in Java, matching the job’s emphasis on C++/Java proficiency.
- **Algorithms:** Implements BFS for pathfinding—showcasing advanced data structures and algorithmic thinking.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Uses Java classes and interfaces (e.g., `HoppersModel`, `AstroModel`, `Configuration`) to encapsulate game logic, aligning with object-oriented development practices.
- **Prototyping & Testing:** The PTUI system serves as a prototype for game interaction; GUI visualization is a production-grade feature.
- **Unit Testing & Documentation:** The codebase includes comments, step-by-step outputs, and sample input/output files for validation.

### Data Analysis & Visualization

- **Visualization:** JavaGFX and PTUI provide graphical and text-based interfaces to visualize solution steps and board states—akin to visualizing large data sets or results.
- **Data Structures:** Manipulates grids, coordinates, and moves, applying complex logic and analysis.

### Collaboration & Communication

- **Teamwork:** Developed collaboratively, with division of roles (Hoppers vs Astros) and integration of algorithms for both games.
- **Status Updates:** Outputs include progress steps, solution paths, and configuration analytics.
- **Documentation:** README and in-code documentation facilitate clear communication and onboarding for future contributors.

### Technical Requirements Met

- **Operating Systems:** Java code is portable across Windows and Linux.
- **Machine Learning/Data Analytics Exposure:** BFS solving and board state analysis provide foundational experience for future ML/data analytics projects.
- **Problem-Solving Skills:** The games are built around solving complex logical puzzles—core to quantitative data analysis and algorithmic thinking.
- **Independent and Team Work:** The project is designed for individual game ownership and joint algorithm development.

### Special Requirements

- **No classified data or government security dependencies are present, but the design and rigor reflect standards required for sensitive projects.**
- **U.S. citizenship and driver’s license requirements are not directly addressed by this repo but are part of the job posting context.**

## Usage

1. **Run either game via PTUI for text-based interaction or JavaGFX for graphical display.**
2. **Sample input and output files are included for testing and experimentation.**
3. **Algorithms and models are extensible for new puzzle types or additional features.**

---

## Summary: Astros vs Hoppers

- **Both puzzles leverage a shared BFS algorithm for intelligent solution searching.**
- **Hoppers focuses on elimination through hopping mechanics; Astros on navigation and reaching a goal.**
- **Both games require strategic planning, pathfinding, and state analysis—the same skills needed for defense/intelligence software development.**
- **Visualization, testing, and clear code structure support robust software engineering practices.**
